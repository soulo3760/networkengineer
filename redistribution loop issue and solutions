redistribution loop issue and solutions
it is common for a route redistributed into routing protocol using the protocols default metric of infinity 00seed metric00.

in complex topologies, looping conditions are likely to occur.
1. Assign higher metrics when entering a AS
	- to avoid being a desirable route when redistributing to an area 	which can cause suboptimal routes
2. set lower administrative distance for the desired protocol to make it more 	believable... for instance chance AD of OSPF to 80, which is lower 	than 90 of EIGRP.
3. Filter redistributed routes
	ASBR and ABR boundaries, filter ip routing in the ospf table. to 	ensure specific routes don't get redistributed.
4. tags. consider it as rubber stamps. 
	if i don't want eigrp routes to be redistributed back by ospf into 	the AS, you can assign the EIGRP routes with a tag of 10. then deny 	tag 10 traffic from being redistributed back at the ospf to eigrp 	boundary. 
route-map TAG10
set tag 10 

now lets create another route map to match traffic to be denied
route-map DENYTAG10 deny 10 
match tag 10
exit 
route-map DENYTAG10 permit 20

router ospf 1
 redistribute eigrp  route-map TAG10
