multicast routing
IGMP 
We will have PCs that want to receive video from a video server join a group
class D multicast 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255
 however there are reserved addresses	
	link-local address - 224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255 - that address is usable one link
			for example ospf 224.0.0.10(EIGRP), ospf (224.0.0.5 n 224.0.0.6)
	globally scoped address - 224.0.1.0 - 238.255.255.255
source specific multicast address - 232.0.0.0 - 232.255.255.255 
	GLOP Addresses = 233.0.0.0 - 233.255.255.255 ( globally unique based on AS )
	limited scope address = 239.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 (PRIVATE NETWORK FOR MULTICAST)

GLOP Addresses = 233.0.0.0 - 233.255.255.255 ( globally unique based on AS )
lets assume AS =  65000
in this case our multicast address space: 233.253.232.0/24
the second and third octet were determined by the AS number  = 253 - 232
65000 = FD-E8 
FD = 253
E8 - 232


FOR IPV6
FF AS THE FIRST two hexadecimal digits
in the scope 4 bits:
FF02::1 - All nodes in the link local scope
FF01::2 - ALL ROUTERS in the link local scope


CONSTRUCTING A MULTICAST MAC ADDRESS
it is automatically constructed from ipv4 multicast address
	step 1
convert the last three octets to binary
	if multicast address is 244.1.10.10
0000.0001.0000.1010.0000.1010
	step 2
change the leftmost bit t 0, if it not already 0
0000.0001.0000.1010.0000.1010
convert each nibble into hex
01.0a.0a
	step 3
prepend 01-00-5e
01-00-5e.01.0a.0a



ANOTHER EXAMPLE ...224.129.10.10
	step 1
convert the last three octets to binary
	if multicast address is 224.129.10.10
224-128 = 96-64-32=0
129-128 = 1
0000.1001.0000.1010.0000.1010
	step 2
change the leftmost bit t 0, if it not already 0,,, we have changed the bit to 0 it was 1
0000.0001.0000.1010.0000.1010
convert each nibble into hex
01.0a.0a
	step 3
prepend 01-00-5e
01-00-5e.01.0a.0a
it is possible to have overlapping multicast MAC address 

IGMP protocol

if there are multiple PCs that want to receive Multicast traffic, they will talk to their next hop routers to hey please send me multicast traffic for this multicast group. the way the way the pc makes this request is using IGMP protocol.

if the router is receiving traffic that group it will know to respond using the interface that the pc is connect.

IGMP snooping. it knows the port to forward the multicast traffic to a specific receiver and not other ports. preventing broadcast....

if the router is not receiving the traffic from that group, it will have to GRAFT itself on the (MDT) Multicast Distribution Tree. 

IGMP reports - 60 seconds timer
IGMPV2 - The receiver can send a leave message
IGMPV3 - The receiver can send icmpv3, it specifies the group and also specific source 			address. source is always unicast, destination is multicast...

REVERSE PATH FORWARDING CHECK

Reverse Path forwarding  check
 this prevents duplication OF multicast traffic, according to my unicast routing table, which ingress interface... if i(receiver) is getting multicast packets from a sender from more than one interface, it will only accept traffic from the interface in which interface (g0/1) wuld use to send traffic back to the sender. 

source distribution tree  - PIM - DM = flood and prune receivers, then if new receiver comes it grafts... this flooding and prune behavior evry 3 minutes is a disadvantage ... despite new models having a state-refresh feature.

shared distribution tree  - PIM-SM -  rendezvous point ...source sends to RP ... if new receiver wants to join to sends IGMP report to RP. (*, G)
ONCE THE RECEIVER SOURCE knows the source of the sender. it will send (S,G) JOIN TO THE SOURCE, AND PRUNE THE RP. to establish optimal path. Shortest path tree switchover.
