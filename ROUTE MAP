ROUTE MAP
route-map LOCALPREF-ISP1
set local-preference 100 
route-map LOCALPREF-ISP2
set local-preference 200
router bgp 65001
neighbor 198.51.100.2 route-map LOCALPREF-ISP1 in
neighbor 198.51.100.6 route-map LOCALPREF-ISP2 in

this will make outbound traffic from this router to choose the higher local preference

what happens to the traffic coming from the internet ?

to make in bound traffic use the faster connection we can use AS-PATH to exaggerate the AS PATH
route-map ASPATH
set as-path prepend 65001 65001 65001

lets apply this to 
BGP bgp 65001
neighbor 198.51.100.2 route-map ASPATH out
end
clear

this will make the faster connection preferred/ discourage use of the slower as it has more AS PATHS
