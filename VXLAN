VXLAN
VIRTUAL EXTENSIBLE LANS
-span l3 boundary VLAN
-12 BIT VLAN filed = 4000 vlans
VXLAN = 16 MILLION vxlans
VXLAN network indentifier (VNI)
 24 bit VNI field

underlay network = physically connected network
using this physical network we can create a logical network, when leaf switches can reach any other leaf switch through the spin switches... using VIM (virtual ethernet module) to communicated over the overlay network...
each vem has atleast one IP address assigned to a special interface called VTEP... Virtual tunnel endpoint.VTEP can pass traffic among themselves. see this explanation
VTEP can connect to another VTEP to form a tunnel

What about multicast, broadcast... we use BUM... 

BUM = BROADCAST, UNKNOWN UNICAST AND MULTICAST

we can have the VTEP join a multicast group
we can have multiple VNi belonging to same multicast group
take this scenario 
server 1 wants to communicate to server 2
server 1
MAC : AAAA.AAAA.AAAA
IP 10.1.1.100
VLAN 10 

server 2
mac: BBBB.BBBB.BBBB
IP: 10.1.1.200
VLAN 10

leaf swi is connected to leaf switch 2 via a spine SW2
WE WILL ASSIGN Leaf switch SW1 VTEP 192.168.1.11
WE WILL ASSIGN Leaf switch SW1 VTEP 192.168.1.33
then 
##########
for server one to connect to server 2, it sends a arp broadcast as it does not know mac address to 10.1.1.200 to reach sw2
so the switch will learn the following:
	- i just learnt that AAAA.AAAA.AAAA MAC address is attached to interface E1/11 which is a member of vlan 10 . vlan 10 is mapped to VNI 100010 

Leaf SWI reaches serve 1 the ARP broadcast, whch is treated as part of BUM traffic.
FOR BUM traffic, SW1 will send it to the multicast group < 239.1.1.10 > of which Spine SW2 and leaf SW3 is a part of... and leaf SW3 will flood it out to its ports... 
once  leaf sw3 gets this traffic in the multicast group 239.1.1.10, IT WILL FLOAD IT OUT TO OTHER PORTS, and Server 2 will respond with its mac address...
SO sw3 WILL learn that 10.1.1.200 with  mac: BBBB.BBBB.BBBB  lives in the port E1/1
so SW3 will respond to the other VTEP with hEY IF YOU WANT TO REACH server 2 come to me giving its ip address 192.168.1.33
AND THIS INFORMATION IS SENT THROUGH SPINE SW2, and leaf SW1 which records the vtep ADDRESS OF THE LEAF SW2.
so LEAF SW1, forms a VXLAN tunnel with leaf SW2
