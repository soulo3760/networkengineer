VXLAN BGP EVPN configurations
	-l3 routing over vxlan 
	- anycast vpc

BGP L2VPN EVPN
use BGP as a mechanism to map and ip address to vxlan tunnel end point.

maps vlans to vxlan network indentifiers (VNIs/VNIDs)

advertise information into BGP

mac to L2 vni TO VTEP(vxlan tunnel end point) Mapping
ip to l3 vni to VTEP mapping 
import mac address into CAM table for bridging 
route traffic through SVI to remote semgnets


so we have server 1 to SW1, and we will send its mac address information using BGP L3VPN EVPN to the other endpoint SW2. now SW2 will know the end point to use to reach the server 1 through SW1.
Basically, its uploading the arp cache into BGP to avoid broadcasting the information over the data plane.


STEPS 
1. MAP vlan to vxlan 
- vn-segment under vlan config mode 
2. create Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) interface
- specify tunnel interface  nve1
3. Specify VTEP source
-source interface loopback0
4. Specify VNI membership 
- member vni (vnid)
5. specify multicast group for BUM replication
- mcast-group (group)
6. specify BGP as control panel protocol
- host-reachability protocol bgp 
7. Establish BGP EVPN peerings
 - address-family l2vpn evpn
 - extended communities required 
-- we have the network set up as leaf-spin-leaf ====something on route reflections
the spins are in data plane, so we host bgp route reflectors. (interfabric reachability)
8. generate BGP advertisements
- evpn  
	- vni (vnid) l2
	- rd auto 
	- route-target import auto
	- route-target export auto
