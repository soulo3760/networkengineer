STP PORT STATES
ROOT BRIDGE... CENTRAL PART OF THE TREE EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED TO IT LIKE THE ROOTS OF A TREE

LAYER 2 PACKETS LEAD TO BROADCAST STORM BECAUSE NO TTL


Bridge ID
	- priority  2 bytes 
	- mac address 6 bytes

who is the route bridge 
- THE LOWER BRUDGE ID is choosen as root bridge 


the port closest to root based on cost is Root Port RP
	- the faster the link the lower the cost
	- 10 Gbps port speed -2 STP port cost
	- 1gbps = 20
....incase of a tie we choose the lowest port ID ON THE FAR END SO IF THE LINKS ARE CONNECTED TO
G1/0/13
G1/0/14
WE WILL CHOOSE THE LINK CONNECTED TO G1/0/13 ON THE FAR END






 designated ports 
- all links going to the root are designated ports
so for designated port on non root bridge
we choose the end of port in the link,  closest to the root bridge in term of cost.
then if we have atie we choose the bridge id to break a tie
..... so the remaining are blocking... 

blocking change to forwarding when one of the links fail.... BPDUS are shared to stay up to date.
