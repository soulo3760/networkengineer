bgp
ibgp - bgp peers in teh same AS
ebgp - bgp peers in different AS


update source l1 command = tells the device to use this loopback one as my source ip address 
for this interface. it defines teh source ip when initiating the TCP connection. 
it is important because it will be used by BGP to authenticate the incoming connection


BGP MESSAGES
open   		
 update    ---==== only optimal and best routes are carried by update message to peers
notification ====  report error and terminate peer relationship
keep alive 
route-fresh == IF ANY CHANGES OCCUR IN THE ROUTING DATABASES


BGP  STATES
THE NEIGHBOR TRANSITIONS ALL THE WAY TO ESTABLISHED 


BGP can import routes using 
network
route-import ospf 

SUMMARIZATION
bgp 200 aggregated


ADVERTISEMENT RULE
 default IBGP behavior
1. multihop sessions are allowed
2. nexthop  remains unchanged 
3. split horizon rule/ so we need to have full mesh between Ibgp peers
4. do no append AS no in  AS_PATH

NLRI CONDITIONS IN IBGP
1. NEXT HOP MUST BE RESOLVABLE, 
2. is my own AS within the AS_path , IBGP will drop the message IF A DEVICE FINDS ITS OWN AS, but it is not the same EBGP

on the multihop issue, 
in IBGP ttl is set to 225
and ebgp ttl is set to 1 

 default EBGP behavior
1. Multihop-session are not allowed
2. nexthop is changed 
3. no split horizon
4. AS n added in the AS_path
 

on split horizon, all routes learned from EBGP peers can be advertised to all peers. 
only in IBGP are route learned fro peers not advertised to peers... it is assumed peers have full mesh. 

advertisement rules.

1. only optimal and valid routers are advertised
2. the routes obtained from EBGP are advertised from all BGP peers
3. IBGP SPLIT HORIZON. the routes obtained from IBGP are not advertised to ibgp peers
4. route synchronization... ibgp cannot advertise this route to ebgp peers unless the router learns from an igp LIKE ospf .. this prevents BGP routing blackholes...
