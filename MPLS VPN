mpls vpn set-up procees:
1. igp  
2. mpls ldp  
3. vrf 
4. mpbgp


mp bgp mpls vpn
ldp 
the ldp helps because the networks between the r1 and r3 but they can still forward the packets to the edge routers

WHEN THE DEVICE LOOKS AT THE FIB, IF THE TUNNEL ID IS ZERO, USE NORMAL IP FORWARDING DECISIONS. 
IF THE TUNNEL ID IS NONE ZERO, THE PACKET MUST BE FORWARDED BASED ON MPLS
SO IT WILL GO TO LSP TO FIND THE AN ENTRY THAT MATCHES THE TUNNEL ID
COMMANDS
dis fib
dis mpls ldp 

after configuring ospf within the isp network 
and enabling mpls on the interfaces involved 
we configure the vrf
ip vpn-instance custa
ipv4-fam 
route-distinguisher 1:1
#route-target 
vpn-target 1:1 both 

# we need to bid vpn to the interface... we are assigning the customer their vrf
int g0/0/0
ip binding vpn-instance custa 
ip add 192.168.1.1 24

and repeat the same for custa 
and then on r3

vpninstance create ospf for cust a


so now we configure the cust a int loop0 and int g0/0 and advertise in ospf 0


ON R1
BGP 100
PEER 3.3.3.3 AS-NUMBER 100
PEER 3.3.3.3 CONNECT-INT LOOP0
IPV4 FAMILY VPNV4
PEER 3.3.3.3 ENABLE 

#dis bgp vpnv4 all peer
dis bgp peer
dis bgp routing table 



we need to import from cust a into bgp
bgp 100
ipv4-f vpn-instance custa
import-route ospf 1


now we can actually see this route in r3,
dis ip routing table vpn-instance custa
dis bgp vpnv4 all routing-table 

now since we have the route on the r3 vrf
we need to use ospf to import the bgp on cust a

we can see that the networks on customer site a from r1 are now introduced into customer site in r3
