MP-BGP 

RD - RD only makes routes unique.  Makes VPNv4 routes unique, Used When converting IPv4 → VPNv4

RT - Controls route sharing, USED When exporting/importing routes, RT = "This route belongs to VPN-X."

Purpose: Controls which VPN sites receive which routes (like a "VPN membership tag").

How it works:

Export RT: Attached when a PE sends a route to MP-BGP.

Import RT: Used by remote PEs to decide whether to accept the route into a VRF.




VPN-A (Bank A)
RD: 65000:100

Export RT: 65000:100

Import RT: 65000:100

Routes: 65000:100:10.1.1.0/24

VPN-B (Bank B)
RD: 65000:200

Export RT: 65000:200

Import RT: 65000:200

Routes: 65000:200:10.1.1.0/24

Result:

Even if both banks use 10.1.1.0/24, their routes won’t mix (thanks to RD).

Only Bank A sites get Bank A routes (thanks to RT).



MP BGP

VPNV4 route is advertised by pe1 to pe2 through MPIBGP update message 

the message carries MP reach NLRI and RT attributes

inner label - VPN label is distributed by MP-BGP of each PE to a VPN route 
Inner Label (VPN): 1024 (identifies the destination VRF on PE2).


each PE determines the VPN to which the data belongs according to the inner label.

Outer label- is distributed by the LDP to the next hop of the VPN route.
the first to be examined is the outer label, the inner label will be used to determining vrf to forward to the destination PE2. 
Outer Label (Transport): Assigned by LDP/RSVP-TE for the path to PE2 (e.g., 2001).



after receiving VPN4 routes, the egress PE performs route-leaking and tunnel recursion to select routes 

The last P Router pops the outer label (PHP = Penultimate Hop Popping).

PE2 receives the packet with only the inner VPN label (1024).

VPN Label Lookup: Matches 1024 to the correct VRF.

IP Forwarding: Checks the VRF’s routing table for 10.2.2.2 and sends to CE2.



Step-by-Step Labels:

CE1 → PE1: IP Packet (10.1.1.1 → 10.2.2.2).

PE1: Encapsulates with labels [Outer=2001, Inner=1024].

P1: Swaps outer label 2001 → 2002 (inner label 1024 unchanged).

P2: Pops outer label (PHP), sends [Inner=1024] to PE2.

PE2: Matches 1024 to VRF-A, forwards to CE2 as plain IP.
